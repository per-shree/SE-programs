# SE AI & DS Project – [Project Title]

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Second Year Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (SE AI & DS) academic project at [Your College/University Name]. The project was developed as part of the [Course Name] curriculum.

**Domain:** Artificial Intelligence / Data Science / Machine Learning  
**Semester:** Semester [1]  
**Year:** Second Year (SE)

## 💡 Project Description

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict student performance based on historical academic data. It employs data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms like Decision Trees and Random Forests. The final model helps identify students at academic risk early in the semester.

## 🔍 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Implementation of ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM)
- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall
- User interface (if applicable)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code / PyCharm  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub
